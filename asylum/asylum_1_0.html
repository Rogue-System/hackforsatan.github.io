            It's old, antique. Might be worth something. There's still a round in the
            chamber. You give the cylinder a spin and snap it back into place. Reminds you
            of Pop's old pistol. He never did take you shooting. Never did nothin', just
            drank. You put it to your temple, cock the hammer, and pull the trigger. CLICK.
            You pop the chamber, spin it. The barrel burns your face. Just drank and hit
            Mom. Hit her til she screamed. Til she spit teeth on the kitchen floor. You
            kept one under your pillow. A part of her you'd always have in case... Cock.
            Pull. CLICK. Spin. Cancer got her first, so he started hittin' you instead. Hit
            you til your skull fractured and you ran off for good. Cock. Pull. CLICK. Spin.
            He didn't have nobody left to hit, so he did right by the world and blew his
            fuckin' brains out in a shed. Cock. Pull. CLICK. I just want to make you proud,
            Pop. Just once. I gotta do right, Pop. Spin. Cock. Just like you. Pull.
