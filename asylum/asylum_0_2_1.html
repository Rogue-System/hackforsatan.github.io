            It's about two feet in diameter, cut jagged into the drywall. Even on full
            blast your headlamp can't cut the darkness inside. You crawl through. CREAK
            CLANK CLICK. Behind you. You struggle to flip onto your back. The hole is gone.
            It's a small metal door with a glass window. There's a man in a white coat on
            the other side. You can see his face. He's scribbling on a clipboard. The walls
            around you are ventilated metal. He clicks his pen. He's humming. It's
            familiar. He's got the little bitter baby in His hands ... HEY! HEY! LET ME OUT
            OF HERE! He can't hear you. He puts the clipboard down and presses a button.
            Flames explode beneath you. He's got the whole world right in His hands.
            HELP!!! He can hear you. He just likes to watch."
