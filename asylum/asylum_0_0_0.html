            It's a syringe. The big, old-timey kind you see in the movies. It's rusty and
            the needle's a little bent, but it's intact. You shake it and--I'll be damned.
            It's been, what, 60 years since this place shut down? Wonder what kind of
            fucked-up cocktail they were givin' those nutjobs. You give the plunger a light
            push and a drop of godknowswhat squirts out the tip. I'll be damned. You find a
            vein easily and give it a slap. The crooked needle still sticks. What are you
            doing? You push the plunger all the way. You'll be damned.
