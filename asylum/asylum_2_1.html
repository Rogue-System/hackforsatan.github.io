            You jump to your feet and grab the toolbox. CLANG. "Bad," the old man
            whispers. You move quickly and quietly to the door. CLANG. A shadow darkens the
            window. You freeze. CLANG. The door rattles. Don't breathe. The shadow
            disappears. CLANG. He's moving on. Now's your chance. A frail, cold hand grabs
            your wrist. You shake it loose and look at the man, or what's left of him. His
            ears and nose are gone. Surgically. Stitched. Both legs amputated at the knee.
            "They killed her and burned her..."
