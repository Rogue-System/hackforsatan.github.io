            You wedge a screwdriver beneath the lock and lean into it hard. The box crashes
            to the ground exposing a hole in the wall. Rats swarm out of it, starving.
            You're up to your shins in a writhing mass of fur, teeth, disease, climbing up
            your legs, ripping at your clothes, flesh. You're transfixed on the hole and
            the unending blackness beyond. You can't help but smile. It's made of skin.
            Just like us.
        </p>
