            You keep your head down and pretend to dig through your box for tools. The sign
            says SANCTUARY now. Just act like you know what you're doing. You grab the
            handle and crack the door. The sign says STAIRWELL again. Fuck this place. You
            slip through the door and shut it behind you. No one saw you. "Can you see
            them?" You spin around and see a man sitting on the landing below, covering
            his face with his hands. He snaps his head up in your direction but keeps one
            hand over his eyes. "The shadows. On the walls! Can you see them?" His mouth
            hangs open on the last word. A silent scream. The harsh glow of the fluorescent
            lights seeps into every crack and corner. There are no shadows. "They're
            inside us you know." His mouth is closed. His hand falls limp from his face,
            exposing the blood-crusted chasms where his eyes used to be. "Why won't they
            let us die?"
