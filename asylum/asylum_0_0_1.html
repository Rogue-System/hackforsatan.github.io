            It looks out of place in here. Better fit for a castle than a nuthouse. It's
            locked by a sliding bolt. Storage, maybe? Something's scratched into the wood
            under the handle. NONE ABOVE. NONE BELOW. ALL OF THEM HERE. Whatever the fuck
            that means. It takes some oil and a wrench but the bolt pops and the door
            creaks open. It's pitch black inside. You flip your headlamp up to full brights
            and see the walls. High walls. Impossibly high. Right? They're covered floor-up
            in scratched words, the same four words, over and over, disappearing into the
            black void where a ceiling should be. ALL OF THEM HERE. ALL OF THEM HERE. "I'm
            an angel..." A whisper. A woman. Where? The door slams behind you and the
            headlamp goes dark. "Can't you see my wings?" You can't see anything at all.
            Who's there?! "You'll be an angel too! I know how!" Your vision goes white
            from the pain. "Isn't it wonderful?" You can hear the peeling. "Isn't Heaven
            so bright?"
