            The poor things are famished, just skin and bone. You pull off your work boots
            and socks, stretch out your feet, and take out the bolt cutters. Just skin and
            bone. Looking up to the heavens, He gave thanks and broke the loaves. One
            little piggy? SNAP. Two little piggy? SNAP. They all ate and were satisfied.
            The floor rumbles again. The rats scatter as you hear a soft CRACK followed by
            a very loud one, then an overwhelming nothing.
